I chose this dataset because I've played the game for a long time. It's also easy to compare info from card to card so I thought it'd be a good option.
The ten questions I want to answer when analyzing this dataset are the following:
1. Which characters appear most frequently in the dataset?
   - Super Saiyan Goku appears the most frequently.
2. What is the distribution of units by rarity (e.g., UR, LR)?
   - SSRs >>> 39.42%
   - URs	>>> 35.05%
   - SRs >>> 12.36%
   - LR >>>	5.81%
   - R	5.56%
   - N	1.79%
3. How are the units distributed across different types (e.g., AGL, TEQ, INT, STR, PHY)?
   - Super STR	12.71%
   - Super TEQ	12.51%
   - Super AGL	12.26%
   - Super PHY	11.97%
   - Super INT	11.57%
   - Extreme STR	8.14%
   - Extreme AGL	7.99%
   - Extreme PHY	7.85%
   - Extreme INT	7.75%
   - Extreme TEQ	7.25%
4. Is there a correlation between the rarity of a unit and its maximum level?
   - The max level is one to one with rarity and usually does not vary. The max level for LRs will always be 150 for example.
5. On average, how long does it take for a unit released on the JP server to come to the global server?
   - 131.95 days.
