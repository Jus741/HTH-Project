I chose this dataset because I've played the game for a long time. It's also easy to compare info from card to card so I thought it'd be a good option.
The ten questions I want to answer when analyzing this dataset are the following:
1. Which characters appear most frequently in the dataset?
2. What is the distribution of units by rarity (e.g., UR, LR)?
3. How are the units distributed across different types (e.g., AGL, TEQ, INT, STR, PHY)?
4. Is there a correlation between the rarity of a unit and its maximum level?
5. How does the release frequency of units vary between JP and Global versions over time?
6. What percentage of the characters have an EZA?
7. What is the average cost of units by rarity and type?
8. What is the average length of unit titles, and does it vary significantly by rarity or type?
9. What is the average time gap between JP and Global releases for units?
10. Do certain characters have more high-rarity units compared to others?
